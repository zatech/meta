# Job Postings

## Overview

At ZATech we get quite a lot of job postings, Having good communication is super important to ensure high signal and low noise.
We don't want to curtail the posts into a strict format, but we do want quality job postings please!

## Guidelines:

If your post doesn't fit into 5 lines, you're probably overdoing it.
If your post is 1 line, you're probably missing important data.

Basic info you really need to have:
* Position
* Company
* Location
* Contact Info 

Suggested extra info
* Salary or at least a salary range
* Link to a web posting with more details

If you're really sold on writing an essay, pleasemake a slack snippet. 
That way it folds up and doesn't blaot the channel.

(Obviously it goes without saying that professional recruitment is not allowed, please see the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/zatech/code-of-conduct) if you're unsure)
