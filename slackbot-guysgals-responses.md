I think you might mean *team*…  
I think you might mean *all*…  
I think you might mean *pals*…  
I think you might mean *gang*…  
I think you might mean *crew*…  
I think you might mean *people*…  
I think you might mean *y'all*…  
I think you might mean *everyone*…  
I think you might mean *everybody*…  
I think you might mean *folk*…  
I think you might mean *fellow humans*…  
Have you considered a more gender-neutral pronoun like *team*?  
Have you considered using a different pronoun instead of *guys*? Because many here (including me) aren't guys?
