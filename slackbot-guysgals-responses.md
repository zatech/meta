You have used a term (guys) that some people in the community do not find inclusionary enough. Please use the gender-neutral term <> in future.

Have you considered a more gender-neutral pronoun like *team*?  
Have you considered using a different pronoun instead of *gals*? Because many in the community (including me) aren't gals?
Some people in the community find "gals" alienating, why not try "lovely humans"?
