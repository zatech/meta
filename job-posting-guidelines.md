# Job Postings

## Meta
At ZATech we get quite a lot of job postings, making things neat and to the point is super important to prevent 1 post taking up the whole page.
At the same time, companies being unique is a big part of their posting, so we don't want to curtail the posts into a strict format.

## Guidelines:

If your post doesn't fit into 5 lines, you're probably overdoing it

Basic info you really need to have:
* position
* company
* location
* contact info 

Suggested extra info
* Salary or at least a salary range
* Link to a web posting with more details

If you're really sold on writing an essay, please do everyone a favour and make a slack snippet. That way it folds up at least :)
