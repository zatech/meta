# Why the Auto Response?

Certain words can make people in the community feel excluded. In particular there was a point raised in #diversity about the word `guys`. 

That's not the MAIN reason why the slackbot auto response exists though. There's a bigger purpose. The purpose is to try and get people to be more aware about the language they use and to try and be more inclusive towards other humans. Regardless of Class, Race, Gender, Sex or other divides that humans love putting up.

We want to be a loving and inclusive community, and we know that the community is made up of the individuals. Thus if the individuals are made more aware of how better to be inclusive to the group, the community as a whole becomes more inclusive.
While you may not use the word in that way, or intend to exclude anyone with your language, people in this community (and the larger tech community in general, not to mention other communities) find it othering.

# What we're not trying to do

This is NOT about policing language or stopping freedom of speech.
It's about getting people to be a little bit more aware of the language they use and the implications of that language.

# I don't agree with this, what now?

Please don't feel excluded or shamed, there's been a huge amount of discussion on several channels about diversity, this slackbot and general inclusivity.
If you want to change something about how it works, be that a copy change or anything, we really do welcome suggestions to refine the bot and are very open about its flaws, limitations and aggravations. It is slightly limited at the moment (it's not a custom bot, simply an auto-responder).

Some relevant channels to look at include:
* `#meta-guys-response` - for talking about this specific slackbot. Please keep all discussion relevant to the bot in this channel
* `#diversity` - Discussion of ways and means of ensuring that groups of people that are under-represented in tech (gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, and class) do not feel excluded and are given every possible opportunity to be part of the community
* `#others` - Stories, advice and sympathy on being an "other" in tech
* `#codeofconduct` - Chatting about the ZATech [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/zatech/code-of-conduct)
* `#asktheadmins` - Want to ask the admins a question but not sure who they are or what's going on, this is the place

# Some frequently asked questions 

* **Isn't it gender neutral in its plural form?** Maybe in certain situations, but which situations those are is ambiguous, [here's an unscientific survey](https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/27/guys-guys-guys/) that shows that not everyone agrees. If you find a better survey, please post it for discussion in the groups above. What is for certain is that there are members of our community that do not think it is gender neutral. 
The dictionary definition is not what we're arguing over, but how it makes people feel.
* **Why is the bot so bad? Why doesn't it DM the user, or x, or y?** The bot exists as it currently exists because it is what is possible with the automated responses. If you know of ways to improve it, please do. `#meta-guys-response` is a good place to discuss improvements to the bot.
